# Socket - Server & Client Connection Using Python

### This repository contains the two different connections :
 1. Single Client Socket Connection :  server and client model so that each can communicate with them.

 2. Multiple Client Socket Connection : server can list all the connections and manage the connections also.



### Python Socket Programming - 

To understand python socket programming, we need to know about three interesting topics â€“ Socket Server, Socket Client and Socket.

So, what is a server? Well, a server is a software that waits for client requests and serves or processes them accordingly.

On the other hand, a client is requester of this service. A client program request for some resources to the server and server responds to that request.

Socket is the endpoint of a bidirectional communications channel between server and client. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different machines. For any communication with a remote program, we have to connect through a socket port.

The main objective of this socket programming tutorial is to get introduce you how socket server and client communicate with each other. You will also learn how to write python socket server program.
